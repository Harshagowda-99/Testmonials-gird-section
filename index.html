   <h3>Daniel Clifford</h3>
  <h5>Verified Graduate</h5>


 <p class="para1"> I received a job offer mid- <br> course, and the subjects I <br> learned were current, if not more <br> so, 
  in the company I joined.  I <br> honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.
</p>
 <p class="para2">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
  transition <br> and have heard some people who had an <br> amazing experience here. I signed up 
  for the <br> free intro course and found it incredibly fun! <br> I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
  The next 12 weeks <br> was the best - and most grueling - time of my <br> life. Since completing 
  the course, I’ve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a <br> Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

  <h3>Jonathan Walters</h3>
  <h5>Verified Graduate</h5>

<p class="para1">The team was very supportive <br> and kept me motivated
</p>
 <p class="para2">“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer 
  for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve <br> made in myself. ”

 <p class="para1"> An overall wonderful and <br> rewarding experience
</p> 
 <p class="para2"> “ Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now <br> have a job I really enjoy, and make a good living <br>
  while doing something I love. ”

  <h3>Patrick Abrams</h3>
 <h5> Verified Graduate</h5>

  <p class="para1">Awesome teaching support from <br> TAs who did the bootcamp  themselves. Getting guidance <br> from them and 
  learning from <br> their experiences was easy.
  </p>
 
 <p class="para2"> “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my <br> progress which I find really refreshing. The <br> program 
  gave me the confidence necessary to be <br> able to go out in the world and present myself as a <br> capable 
  junior developer. The standard is above the <br> rest. You will get the personal attention you need <br> from 
  an incredible community of smart and <br>  amazing people. ”

  <h3>Kira Whittle</h3>
<h5>Verified Graduate</h5>

 <p class="para1"> Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
</p>
<p class="para2"> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a <br> line of code. I needed some structure from <br>
  professionals who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a <br> former 
  student of theirs who can only say <br> wonderful things about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff 
  did not disappoint. They were <br> very hands-on and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team 
  project, in particular, <br> was outstanding. It took my learning to the next <br> level in a way that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an <br> example of my developent 
  experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after <br> receiving multiple offers. 
  100% recommend! ” </p>
